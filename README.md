Fork of FakeShemp's DIC-GUI
"This is a very simple GUI for DiscImageCreator. Currently, it is kinda functional, contains no safety-checks and is a WIP."

Added thusfar: 
              Check if Single or Multi-track DISC
              CRC calculation (probably better to just read .dat file!)
              Check if new disc or verification via scraping Redump DB with crc
              Add new profiles - inc. test profile for non-plextor prototyping (data 0 1000 small lba read)
